    "\n",
    "We've already used Pandas to import data in previous lessons, but in this lesson we'll take a little longer to dive into what's actually going on.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Objectives\n",
    "You will be able to:\n",
    "* Import data from csv files and Excel files\n",
    "* Understand and explain key arguments for imports\n",
    "* Save information to csv and Excel files\n",
    "* Access data within a Pandas DataFrame (print() and .head())\n",

    "## Importing Data\n",
    "\n",
    "There are a few main functions for importing data into a pandas DataFrame including:\n",
    "\n",
    "* `pd.read_csv()`\n",
    "* `pd.read_excel()`\n",
    "* `pd.read_json()`\n",
    "* `pd.DataFrame.from_dict()`\n",
    "\n",
    "Most of these methods are fairly straightforward; you use `.read_csv()` for csv files, `.read_excel()` for excel files (both new and old .xlx and .xlsx) and `.read_json()` for json files. That said, there are a few nuances you should know about. The first is that the `.read_csv()` format can be used for any plain-text delimited file. This may include (but is not limited to) pipe (|) delimited files (.psv) and tab separated files (.tsv).\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's look at an example by investigating a file, bp.txt, stored in the Data folder."
